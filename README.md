Since I found Tough As Nails, my friend and I had one issue: Maintaining body temperature was a drag. 

Every few minutes, we had to stop mining, and run next to a heat source in order to not die of Hypothermia.

Due to that issue, I decided to create a mod, which adds a few new items that makes maintaining temperature easier.

Cue, Extra TAN.

What does it add?

Cool Drink

Hot Drink

Super Cool Drink

Super Hot Drink

All of these drinks slightly push your body temperature in a different direction:

Cool Drink reduces your core temperature slightly, Super Cool Drink reduces your core temperature drastically.

Hot Drink increases your core temperature slightly, Super Hot Drink increases your core temperature drastically.

 

Recipes will be displayed here at some point. For now, NEI/JEI will assist you where needed.

 

THIS MOD REQUIRES TOUGH AS NAILS TO WORK

 

Can I use this in Modpacks?

Yes.

Do you have a GitHub? And if so, what's the repository link?

Yes. It's at: https://github.com/matthe815/Extra-TAN
